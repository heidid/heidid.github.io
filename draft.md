## I have experience with...
- **frontend engineering**, mostly in React. Currently, I'm lucky to be interning with The New York Times, working on NYT Cooking!
- **thinking about design systems**, from my past internship at Flexport.
- **the human-centered design process**, having worked on product design for clients through Berkeley Innovation.
- **teaching web design and development** to 100+ students every week, as a previous instructor of the Web Design DeCal (CS 198).


## I’m currently trying to get better at...
- **graphic design and illustration**, by creating outreach materials for UC Berkeley’s Information Security Office.


## In the future, I think I would enjoy working on...
- **designing for education**. Right now, I’m exploring improvements to the remote learning experience.
- **interactive storytelling**, and use my technical skills for more creative forms.
- **human-computer interaction research**, to explore and critique the experiences we can facilitate with technology and new media.

## Thanks to the classes I’ve taken at Berkeley, I want to learn more about...
- **urban design**, with an emphasis on the social and cultural factors behind our landscape.
- **improving food security**. Taking Art 160 really opened my eyes to these issues, especially among students.
- **printmaking**! Particularly letterpress and relief prints.
