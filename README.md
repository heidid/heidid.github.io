## hello!
I'm Heidi, a senior at UC Berkeley studying computer science + design innovation. this is to become some sort of personal website, supposedly..



### I have experience with...
- **frontend engineering**. Currently, I'm lucky to be interning with The New York Times, working on [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/)!
- **thinking about design systems**, from my past internship at Flexport.
- **the human-centered design process**, having worked on product design for clients through [Berkeley Innovation](https://www.berkeleyinnovation.org/).
- **teaching web design and development** to 100+ students every week, as a previous instructor of the [Web Design DeCal](https://wdd.io/) (CS 198).


### I’m currently trying to get better at...
- **graphic design and illustration**, by creating educational toolkits for UC Berkeley’s [Information Security Office](https://security.berkeley.edu/).


### In the future, I think I would enjoy working on...
- **designing for education** 
- **interactive storytelling**, and use my technical skills for more creative forms.
- **human-computer interaction research**, to explore and critique the experiences we can facilitate with technology and new media.


### Thanks to the classes I’ve taken at Berkeley, I want to learn more about...
- **urban design**, with an emphasis on the social and cultural factors behind our landscape.
- **improving food security**. Taking Art 160 really opened my eyes to these issues, especially among students.
- **printmaking**! Particularly letterpress and relief prints.


_—Heidi_
