## Project Overview
In collaboration with HP, we explored the experiences of virtual elementary school classrooms to improve hands-on learning for teachers and students ages 5 to 8. I was primarily responsible for leading user research and prototyping the software component of our product.


## Identifying Opportunities
**Stakeholders:** Initially, we created a 2x2 matrix to help us identify the key stakeholders who would be involved in our product opportunity. This helped us determine that **younger children**, **elementary school teachers**, and **those who teach hands-on subjects** are impacted by distance learning the most.

**Secondary research:** We researched online about the **social**, **economic**, and **technological** factors of remote learning and learned about the difficulties of:

- social engagement when classrooms are not in-person
- how economic inequalities affect the technological resources available (thus affecting quality of distance learning)
- how technical difficulties impact teachers and students who are not used to using so much technology.


**Customer segmentation:** We created a customer segmentation of teachers and students to better understand who we want our target audience to be.

- Teachers were segmented based on **teaching styles** and how much they incorporated technology in their classrooms. We hypothesized that the more **low-tech teachers** are most impacted by the pandemic, and thus our product should address their needs more.
- Students were segmented based on **learning styles**. We hypothesized that the **physical (kinesthetic) learners** and **social learners** are most impacted by the pandemic, and thus our product should address their needs more.


Overall, we determined that we would center our project around elementary school teachers and students in kindergarten through third grade..
