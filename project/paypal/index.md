I interned on the Merchant Onboarding team in San Jose, and worked on new UI components to lessen confusion throughout the signup flow. Specifically, I created a date input component ([seen here](https://www.paypal.com/bizsignup/#/personalInfo)), progress bar, and credit card statement descriptor in React, and integrated these into the Node.js webapp.
